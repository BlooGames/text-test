Meet the President
==================

*At the Bloom festival*

Kelsey: Warpool, oh Warpoooool. Come out, come out, wherever you are.

How hard is it to find a president around here!?

Santis: Shush! Over there.

*President Warpool appears, talking to Gregory Fife*

Fife: President Warpool! It is an honour.

Warpool: And you are?

Fife: Gregory Fife, captain of the Whimrock army.

Warpool: Ah.

Fife: To think, not so long ago our countries were hurling their might at each other. Ha, ha!

But that’s over now. A toast!

To peace, and the newly elected president of Nork!

Warpool: Quite. Say, where is the Queen tonight?

Fife: She’s having a night in. I’m afraid she’s under the weather.

Santis: Is the Queen alright!?

Kelsey: Well, she’s not big on these events, and I wanted to have some fun tonight...

Look, queens have sickies too!

Santis: This is my chance.

Kelsey: How do you take a fragment, anyway? Do you run up and nick it!?

Santis: No, you just concentrate real hard. Like...

*Battle for Warpool’s fragment. During the fight...*

Warpool: I see you.

Surprised? Don’t you know?

Every president elected since Nork’s foundation has been an awakened.

I assume the Queen sent you. Good.

Let’s play.

*After a few rounds of weak attacks from Warpool*

Warpool: Are you trained by Fallonine? I’ve heard all about them.

They believe in some kind of common good. Noble, but misguided.

In Nork, we have a phrase:

“Each for their own, and we’re all accounted for”.

Your Queen understands that better than most.

*A bit more...*

Warpool: I could crush you if I wanted.

*A ball of fire brings Santis to 1 health*

Warpool: Still, this is in my interests.

Take my fragment back to your Queen.

*Player finishes fight*

Kelsey: Ah! He’s looking right this way!

Santis: Ugh...

Kelsey: Come on, let’s go!

---

Kelsey: Did you get the fragment?

Santis: Yeah, but he was... in my head.

Kelsey: Ew! No-one wants some random poking around in their noggin.

Santis: What’s done is done.

Kelsey: You’re sounding more like Fallonine already.

So, what did you wanna do now?

Santis: Honestly? I just want to sleep.

Kelsey: Aww. I guess you’ve had a long day.

Well, I’ll just have to have an extra carriage ride on your behalf!

Santis: Go for it. Oh, and Kelsey?

Think fast!

Kelsey: Wah! Caught it!

*Kelsey holds up yellow rose*

Santis: Gotcha back. You thought I wouldn’t notice?

Happy Bloom festival!

*Santis leaves*

Kelsey: Hah... ha.
